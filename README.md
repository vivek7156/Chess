## The app is hosted in the render free version, the link for the game is
## - https://chess-jepn.onrender.com/

### The game can be played by just opening the link which will connect you to the server. If two player joined the server like this, the game will start.
### If after this anyone joins the server they will get into spectator mode.
### I am using Chess.js for the game part so the rules are same and you have to drag and drop the pieces.
